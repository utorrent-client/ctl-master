Features
--------


Getting Started
---------------

Download utorrentctl.py and config.py. Edit config.py to edit your connection defaults.
It's not required, but it's more convenient to have them. Run python utorrentctl.py --help.
utorrentctl detects that it is run as command line utility and displays usage help. There
is no documentation at the moment, so for basic usage refer to the example code in
utorrentctl.py (after if __name__ == '__main__')


Requirements
------------

- Python 3.1+ (http://www.python.org/download/)
- Any OS (right now only tested on Linux)
